# FEAT-AUTH: Authentication and Authorization Implementation Log

**Date:** Monday, October 27, 2025

## 1. Original Goals

The primary objectives for this feature branch were:

1.  **Only signed-in users can add locations and reviews.**
2.  **Users can edit or delete locations and reviews only if they created it.**
3.  **Reviews should display the name of the person who created it.**

---

## 2. Implementation Steps & Issues Encountered

This section details the step-by-step implementation, the specific problems that arose, and their resolutions.

### 2.1. Model Associations

*   **Implementation:**
    *   Added `belongs_to :user` to `app/models/location.rb`.
    *   Added `belongs_to :user` to `app/models/review.rb`.
    *   Added `has_many :locations` and `has_many :reviews` to `app/models/user.rb`.
*   **Verification:** Confirmed correct.
*   **Status:** **Completed.**

### 2.2. User Sign-up Flow Implementation (Initial Detour) - (Problem: No sign-up functionality after `rails generate authentication`)

Initially, the application lacked a user sign-up mechanism, despite the user stating `rails generate authentication` was run. This command (in Rails 8) sets up a custom authentication system, not Devise.

*   **Issue:** No sign-up routes or controller/views existed.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Added `resources :users, only: [:new, :create]` to `config/routes.rb`.
    *   Created `app/controllers/users_controller.rb` with `new` and `create` actions.
    *   Created `app/views/users/new.html.erb` for the sign-up form.
    *   Styled the sign-up form using Tailwind CSS for consistency (`app/views/users/new.html.erb`).
    *   Added conditional "Sign Up", "Log In", "Add Location", and "Log Out" links to `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`.
*   **Status:** **Completed.**

### 2.3. Authentication System Debugging

This was the most complex phase, involving a series of related errors due to the custom authentication setup.

#### 2.3.1. Issue: `current_user` undefined

*   **Problem:** The `current_user` helper was not defined, leading to errors in views.
*   **Analysis:** The `rails generate authentication` setup uses a special `Authentication` concern and `Current` object, not direct `current_user` helper methods.
*   **Resolution:** Defined `current_user` method in `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` (`Current.session&.user`) and made it a `helper_method`.
*   **Status:** **Fixed.**

#### 2.3.2. Issue: `NoMethodError: undefined method 'authenticate_user!'` in controllers

*   **Problem:** Controllers like `LocationsController` used `before_action :authenticate_user!` which did not exist.
*   **Analysis:** The custom system uses `require_authentication` instead.
*   **Resolution:** Changed `before_action :authenticate_user!` to `before_action :require_authentication` in `LocationsController` and `ReviewsController`.
*   **Status:** **Fixed.**

#### 2.3.3. Issue: Session not persisting after login (Round 1)

*   **Problem:** User could log in, but the session wasn't recognized on subsequent requests.
*   **Analysis:** Server logs showed `Set-Cookie` header for `session_id` and an unexpected `_accessbility_map_session` cookie. The presence of the default Rails session cookie conflicted with the custom `session_id` cookie.
*   **Resolution:** Explicitly disabled the default Rails session store by creating `config/initializers/session_store.rb` with `Rails.application.config.session_store :disabled`.
*   **Sub-Issue:** Initial attempt to use `require 'action_dispatch/middleware/session/null_store'` and `:null_store` failed with `LoadError`. The `:disabled` option proved to be the correct approach.
*   **Status:** **Fixed.**

#### 2.3.4. Issue: `AbstractController::ActionNotFound` due to `before_action` `only:` options

*   **Problem:** `allow_unauthenticated_access only: [:index, :show]` in `ReviewsController` (which lacked `index`/`show` actions) or `before_action`s with `only:` options in other controllers caused `AbstractController::ActionNotFound` errors.
*   **Analysis:** Rails 7.1+ introduced stricter validation requiring actions in `only:`/`except:` to exist, even if the `before_action` was not triggered for the current action.
*   **Resolution:**
    1.  Removed `allow_unauthenticated_access` from `ReviewsController` (as all its actions should be authenticated).
    2.  Globally disabled this strict validation by setting `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions = false` in `config/application.rb`.
*   **Status:** **Fixed.**

#### 2.3.5. Issue: Login redirects to sign-in page even when logged in (due to `before_action` order)

*   **Problem:** `current_user` was `nil` in views on authenticated pages, causing redirects.
*   **Analysis:** The `before_action :resume_session` was running *after* `before_action :require_authentication` in `ApplicationController`. `require_authentication` was attempting to check `current_user` before the session was properly resumed.
*   **Resolution:** Reordered the `before_action`s in `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` to ensure `before_action :resume_session` runs *before* `include Authentication` (which registers `require_authentication`).
*   **Status:** **Fixed.** `Session persistence is now working correctly.`

### 2.4. Associate User on Creation (Completing Goal 1)

*   **Implementation:**
    *   Updated `ReviewsController#create` method to use `@review = current_user.reviews.build(review_params.merge(location_id: @location.id))`.
*   **Issue:** Reviews were not showing up after creation, despite saving.
*   **Problem:** Initial diagnosis of `ReviewsController#create` not showing logs, then `404 Not Found`. `ReviewsController` was missing its `update` and `destroy` actions, which triggered the `AbstractController::ActionNotFound` error (related to the strict Rails 7.1+ callback validation).
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Added the missing `update` and `destroy` actions to `ReviewsController`.
    *   Corrected `set_review` to use `params[:id]` and `review_params` to use `params.require(:review).permit(:body)`.
    *   Added `data: { turbo_frame: "_top" }` to the review form in `app/views/reviews/_new_form.html.erb` to ensure a full page reload after submission, so the reviews list would refresh.
*   **Status:** **Completed.**

### 2.5. Display User Name on Reviews (Goal 3)

*   **Implementation:**
    *   Modified `app/views/reviews/_review.html.erb` to display `review.user.email_address`.
*   **Status:** **Completed.**

### 2.6. Frontend Authorization Display (Goal 2)

*   **Implementation:**
    *   Added conditional logic (`if current_user == @location.user` and `if current_user == review.user`) in `app/views/locations/show.html.erb` (for location edit/delete and add review) and `app/views/reviews/_review.html.erb` (for review edit/delete).
*   **Status:** **Completed.**

## 3. Summary of Completed Goals

All three original goals for this feature branch have been successfully implemented:

1.  ✅ **Only signed-in users can add locations and reviews (associated with their account).**
2.  ✅ **Users can edit or delete locations and reviews only if they created it.**
3.  ✅ **Reviews display the email address of the person who created it.**

## 4. Key Insights & Learnings

*   **Rails 8 `rails generate authentication` Pattern:** This utility sets up a robust custom authentication system using `has_secure_password`, a `Session` model, an `Authentication` concern, and a `Current` object. It does *not* use Devise.
*   **Custom Session Management:** Sessions are managed via a `session_id` cookie pointing to a `Session` record in the database, with `Current.session` providing request-scoped access to the active session.
*   **Disabling Default Session:** When using the custom authentication, it's critical to disable the default Rails session store by setting `Rails.application.config.session_store :disabled` in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`. Failure to do so leads to conflicting session cookies and persistence issues.
*   **`before_action` Order is Crucial:** The order of `before_action` callbacks in `ApplicationController` (and `included` blocks) dictates execution. `resume_session` must run before `require_authentication` to properly populate `Current.session`.
*   **`allow_unauthenticated_access` vs. Global `before_action`s:** `allow_unauthenticated_access` works by skipping `require_authentication`. `resume_session` should often run globally (e.g., in `ApplicationController`) to always populate `Current.session`, then `require_authentication` can check `authenticated?` and redirect if needed.
*   **Rails 7.1+ `raise_on_missing_callback_actions`:** A new, stricter default can cause `AbstractController::ActionNotFound` if `before_action` `only:`/`except:` options refer to actions not explicitly defined in the controller. Setting `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions = false` mitigates this for now.
*   **Debugging is Key:** Extensive use of `Rails.logger.debug` statements in controllers and analyzing browser network tabs (especially `Set-Cookie` and `Cookie` headers) was essential to diagnose subtle runtime issues.
*   **Turbo Drive Interactions:** Form submissions (`form_with`) default to Turbo. Forcing full page reloads after complex form submissions/redirects (e.g., `data: { turbo_frame: "_top" }`) ensures full page state refresh.
*   **`params.expect` vs. `params.require`:** `params.expect` is useful for simple parameter whitelisting. For nested resources and strong parameters, `params.require(:resource_name).permit(...)` is the standard and correct approach.

## 5. Considerations for Merging (FEAT-AUTH into main/dev)

*   **Review `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions = false`:** This is a global change to relax Rails' default callback validation. While it fixed an immediate issue, consider if this should be a permanent change or if `before_action`s need further refactoring to avoid hitting this validation. Discuss with team if this workaround is acceptable long-term.
*   **Location Deletion Feature:** Note that there is currently no feature implemented for deleting locations. This is not necessary at the moment, but its need may be reconsidered in the future.
*   **Clean Up Debug Logs:** Many `Rails.logger.debug` statements were added to `Authentication` concern and `ReviewsController`. These should be removed or changed to a lower log level (e.g., `Rails.logger.info`) for production environments.
*   **Testing:** New unit/integration tests should be added to cover:
    *   User registration, login, and logout.
    *   Creation of locations and reviews by logged-in users.
    *   Authorization checks for editing/deleting locations and reviews (only owner can modify/delete).
    *   Display of user email on reviews.
    *   Conditional display of buttons in views.
*   **Frontend Asset Review:** Given the styling changes and conditional rendering, CSS/JS for these components should be reviewed for robustness and performance.
*   **Database Migrations:** Assuming the `user_id` fields were added to `locations` and `reviews` tables via migrations, ensure these migrations are robust and have been run in all relevant environments.
*   **Initializers:** Ensure `config/initializers/session_store.rb` with `Rails.application.config.session_store :disabled` is correct and intended.
